The problem is solved using the **binary search algorithm**, which efficiently finds the index of a target number in a sorted array or determines the index where it would be inserted while maintaining the sorted order. The PHP code provided implements this algorithm in the **searchInsert()** function. It takes a sorted array and a target number as input, and returns the index where the target is found or the index where it would be inserted.
